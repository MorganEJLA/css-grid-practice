## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- I was more focused on using this as a way to get better at CSS Grid.

## My process
I did a code along on YouTube, as I needed a refresher in CSS Grid, one of the things that I took away from this was using the Layout tab in the Dev Tools. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- grid-template-areas



### What I learned

This was just a exercise on dealing with different types of grids and doing it in a simple way. 

### Continued development
Using the Dev Tools and the Layout Grid has been something that I have not done before so this is something I would like to make a habit of in future front end mentor challenges.
